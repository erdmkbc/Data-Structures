## Code Complexity and Big-o Notation 

Software steps needs to optimizated by time because the codes are runing to CPU and we have to carry the our CPU and we cant test with runing time because diffrent CPU gives a diffrent perform in algorithms so we cant test with Big-O notation. 

### So what is the Big-O notation ? 

*Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.*

As we can see, the big-o notation is changeing by input form and the repository has kernel that i explained(Big-O-Algorithm-Complexity).
